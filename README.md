# Your Workday Tasklist

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to create a simpler design of a daily calendar to make life a little easier. We built this project to help those looking to bring some order into their lives. Your Workday Tasklist eliminates confusion and helps you focus on one day at a time. No more wrong dates or missed appointments with this simplistic design. This project helped us learn a lot. GitHub was definitely a hurdle for us but with the help of instructors, we feel more confident in handling issues as they arise. We learned how to add bootstrap and outside sourcing for fonts into our project. We also learned how to write correct JavaScript code to allow our tasks to be added automatically into the correct categories after hitting submit without the need to refresh the page.
